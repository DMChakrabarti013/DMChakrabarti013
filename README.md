# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm (@DMChakrabarti013), a senior pursuing a double major in economics and mathematics.

## What I'm Passionate About
I have a deep passion for statistical and economic analysis, with a keen focus on exploring causal relationships between economic policies and their impacts. My expertise lies in binary treatment cases, and I enjoy developing time series models for continuous treatments.

## My Coding Arsenal
When it comes to coding, my weapon of choice is R, where I orchestrate the symphony of data. Occasionally, I find myself in the elegant world of Mathematica and MATLAB, crafting solutions that align with the beauty of mathematical abstraction.

## Collaboration and Projects
I'm on the lookout for exciting collaboration opportunities! My sweet spots are in economics and finance, ranging from theoretical discussions to applied projects. Let's create something meaningful together.

## Let's Connect!

Thanks for dropping by! ðŸš€
