- 👋 Hi, I’m @DMChakrabarti013, an undergrad senior double majoring in economics and mathematics.
- 👀 I’m interested in statistical and economic analysis, particularly in exploring causal relationships between economic policies and their effects in binary treatment cases and developing time series models for continuous treatments.
- 🌱 I’m amateur programmer in R, while learning continually. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects of interest, but I prefer settings in economics and finance, whether theoretical or applied.
- 📫 How to reach me: chakrabartidwaipayan@gmail.com
